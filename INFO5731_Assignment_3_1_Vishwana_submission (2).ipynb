I got it for my birthday, and so far it is very lively, and really cute.I had to take it to Macy's for them to resize it, because it is extremely difficult, and I couldn't do it. (even though the lady didn't want to do it because it wasn't purchased from there, and she didn't want to be held liable for any problems, but after some convincing, she did it for me). I had 2 links removed, and now it's perfect.I did wash dishes with it and even tried showering with it to check the water resistance, and I had absolutely no problem with it.My only complaint/problem is the day of the month. I don't like how it goes up by 10, and there's a small space between the numbers, and no dashes for the in between days, so when I try checking the day, I just have to estimate. Like if it's the 7th, on the watch it looks like anything from 6-8. My husband has a watch that actually says the number, and there was another fossil watch for $10 more that said the actual number, but I got this watch instead.Other than that, I have no other complaints so far. It's not loud. I've always had that problem with other watches, the tick tock always kept me from sleeping. Even right now, the wall clock sounds so loud, but I don't have that problem with this watch, and actually, I never even noticed a sound on it.I still need more time with it, but this is all I noticed with it so far. If I have any other pros or cons, I will update my review. (Cosine Similarity: 0.10545887603094954)\n",

        "# The task encompassed a range of subjects and methodologies in the field of natural language processing (NLP), presenting both difficulties and pleasures. The task encompassed N-gram analysis, TF-IDF computation, document representation, establishment of a word embedding model, and the development of a sentiment analysis dataset. Starting from scratch, the job was to write code that would count the frequency of N-grams, figure out bigram probabilities, extract noun phrases, and figure out how likely each one was to happen. The work also included the calculation of TF-IDF and the building of a document-term matrix, which provided good opportunities for learning. The challenge additionally entailed developing a word embedding model using the dataset, necessitating the use of trial and error. In order to complete the challenge, a sentiment analysis dataset had to be created, which required attentive reading and comprehension of the material. Though I learned a lot from the project, I think it would be better to use pre-existing libraries and frameworks to make things more efficient and reliable in the real world."
