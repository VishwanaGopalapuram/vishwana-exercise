has a thin screen protector on it The phone itself is slim  lightweight and built well  It is 5 5   and has both front and back cameras  It is 3G which is fine as we mostly use wifi anyway  The camera is one of my favorite things about this phone  It takes awesome  clear  bright pictures This cell phone stays charged for a long time even with lots of use  I love that it doesn t have a ton of pre installed  useless apps on it that you can t uninstall  It also charges from the top instead of the bottom like most phones do which is great of you like to use your phone while it charges This is a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends I received this unlocked cell phone by Juning for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion  This in no way affects how I feel about the product or my review of it \",\n          \"phone reception poor with incoming calls\",\n          \"Screen quality is good  Overall  the phone is very slow and has very limited memory  Next to impossible to add additional apps  Instructions are very poor   they seem to have been translated from Chinese into English using a computer translator  so not much of it makes sense in English  Almost no instructions for how to insert the SIM card  except for an illustration which doesn t tell you how to do it so that it doesn t disappear into the phone housing  causing you to have to take the entire phone housing apart to get it back out  For  40  I guess it isn t bad though \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

            "First off, let me say I've been a Nokia user since I had my first cell phone at age 16, ten years ago. Of course there was that one year where I ventured off into Samsung land but that phone died and back to Nokia I went. But I've always enjoyed Nokia phones.Second, I've been looking for a QWERTY phone with internet/video/mp3 playing capabilities and the Asha 302 fits it. It is a strong build, as I have dropped it numerous times and the phone is still intact. I like the keyboard as I am not a fan of touchscreens at all (which is why I didn't get the Asha 303). As far as sound I think it depends on your headphones. I had earbuds that produced a loudness of 93 decibels which made the listening experience mediocre but then I bought buds with a 110 db loudness and the sound is much better. Nokia Xpress is a bit sucky but I downloaded an Opera browser for the phone and it works slightly better so internet experience is pretty easy. I won't get into video games and SNS because I don't even do that on my PC so I don't have a reason to use it on my phone.My only wish is that the 302 had a built in antenna so I could listen to re radio without RDS earbuds. Other than that, it's a really great phone and for those who want to move up into Blackberrys but don't want to pay so much the Nokia Asha 302 is a great phone to start with.EDIT (October 3, 2013): I found a Gino 25cm 4 Section Telescoping Stainless Steel AM FM Radio Antenna 3.5mm Plug to use for playing the radio through the speaker. So now I'm really enjoying the phone for when I'm sitting outside with friends or at my desk.\n",

            "Keeping in mind that this is a sub $100 phone that has generally been advertised as the \"cheapest quad-core phone,\" the Landvo L800 has turned out to be a good phone that has exceeded my expectations. From all my research, Landvo seems to be a new company and the L800 was their first model which they released in March of 2014. I took a risk (although less than $100 isn't a huge risk) in buying this in April with no reviews available. The main thing I was looking for was the most powerful, inexpensive phone at the $100 price point. Battery life was also a major factor. So I purchased this phone on the basis of being the only phone in the price range at the time with a quadcore processor and also because it sports a 2300mah battery which was about the largest battery at the price point of the available models.There were a lot of things I immediately liked about the phone. Despite the low resolution and lack of IPS, the screen is pretty crisp and the viewing angles are more than decent. The battery life has also been good--as I have been averaging two days of average use on a full charge. One day of heavy use would usually put me around the 30% range which still isn't bad. I also was almost shocked by the build quality. The phone is heavier than most name-brand competition in its size class but it has a weighty, solid feel too it. The sides are metal, as are the volume rocker and power button. There are no creaks and everything fits together tightly. Fit and finish is top notch. I believe the screen is plastic and not glass, however. Their are pros and cons to this as a plastic screen is susceptible to scratching. However, it does mean that I will never have to worry about a cracked screen if I drop the phone. The phone came with a screen protector prefitted on the phone and an additional one in the box. The included silicone case is relatively simple but was also a nice touch, especially owing to the fact that a no-name brand phone is unlikely to have third party support for cases and such.However, I would not have recommended this phone to anyone at the time. Why? Because performance was lackluster. The quadcore SoC is quite snappy however, the small 512mb of ram was suffering on Android 4.2.2. I was wary of purchasing a phone with less than 1gb of ram and I was regretting it at this point. It would freeze and stutter during even the simplest tasks such as hammering out a text. I put forth my best efforts to streamline my system as much as possible to keep it running smoothly but the fact was it just didn't have enough ram to power Android comfortably. I was ready to ditch the phone for something new.I have completely changed my tune, however, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this phone in a heartbeat. Why? Surprisingly, Landvo has supported with releasing an official 4.4 KitKat rom for the phone. For those who are tech savvy, this is a boon. KitKat was actually streamlined by Google so that devices with only 512mb of ram can run it comfortably (4.2 was a bit of a resource hog). At this point, I figured I had nothing to lose--I was planning on dumping the phone anyways. Needless to say, flashing to KitKat made a world of difference. The performance is literally night and day as upgrading to 4.4 literally got rid of *all* the lag I was experiencing with the phone. It is now quite fast--I would argue faster than my Sero 7 Pro tablet which is running the old but venerable Tegra 3 processor. Demanding, apps load quickly without stuttering. Animations are smooth and everything has become a joy to use with this phone.If you are looking for a ridiculously cheap, but fast 5.0\" Android phone with good battery life and good build quality, this is the one you are looking for hands down. It's not going to compete with TOTL phones out there but for a measly $95, you shouldn't be expecting that. What you get is a perfectly usable phone at an almost throw away price. I've noticed vendors selling the L800 with Android 4.4 already installed so it looks like the new stock of this phone has been upgraded. If you are not tech savvy and comfortable with flashing your phone, make sure you purchase one with 4.4 already installed! You will love it if you do.\n",

installed  useless apps on it that you can t uninstall  It also charges from the top instead of the bottom like most phones do which is great of you like to use your phone while it charges This is a great phone for the price and I would definitely recommend it to my family and friends I received this unlocked cell phone by Juning for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion  This in no way affects how I feel about the product or my review of it \",\n          \"phone reception poor with incoming calls\",\n          \"Screen quality is good  Overall  the phone is very slow and has very limited memory  Next to impossible to add additional apps  Instructions are very poor   they seem to have been translated from Chinese into English using a computer translator  so not much of it makes sense in English  Almost no instructions for how to insert the SIM card  except for an illustration which doesn t tell you how to do it so that it doesn t disappear into the phone housing  causing you to have to take the entire phone housing apart to get it back out  For  40  I guess it isn t bad though \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n

My Son liked his old one that finally fell apart after 2.5+ years and didn't want an upgrade!! Thank you Seller, we really appreciate it & your honesty re: said used phone.I recommend this seller very highly & would but from them again!!\n",

Techniques including TF-IDF vectorization, punctuation removal, and noise reduction were addressed. Additionally, density-based clustering and KMeans clustering techniques were shown. Text input was converted into numerical vectors for machine learning algorithms using methods like Bag-of-Words representation and TF-IDF vectorization. The focus was on robustness and efficiency, with refactoring to increase efficiency and managing edge cases and exceptions. Additionally, comments and explanations were included to make it easier to read.\n",
